# Classification-Project

# Project overview


Steps

1. I want to get a feel for the data:
    - What is the type of the data
    - What kind of features do I have
    - What is the distribution of the data like
    - Correlation betweens features
    
2. Data exploration
    - What are some intuitive ideas about what it would take to survive on the Titanic?
        - Wealthy vs non-wealthy
        - male vs female
        - children vs adults
        - traveling alone vs in groups
        - location on the ship
    - What are the value counts like for features based on the survived vs deceased?
    
    
    
    
 
3. What kind of data manipulation has to be done to create models for this data set?
     - Deal with missing values
         - What data is to be dropped vs imputed
     - How should data be transformed?
         - get_dummies for categorical variables
     - How should data be scaled?
         - Should we do MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler?
         
         
         
         
4. Create all classification models you know
     - Logistic Regression
     - KNN
     - SVM
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forests
     - Boosting Methods
     - Naive Bayes
     
5. GridSearch best params and find your best model
     - Can show performance emtrics like classification report and plot the confusion matrix
     
     
     
     
6. Conclude the project and make a submission to kaggle
